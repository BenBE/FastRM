FastRM
======

This is a straight forward implementation of Reed-Muller codes.
It's aim is to experiment with various sizes of RM codes in an
easy to implement way.

Neither the encoder nor decoder are aimed to be fast, but they
should be minimally functional.

Inspiration
===========

This library was inspired by a recent
[paper](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2023/162/)
that got to my attention, that showed an lower bound for
linear 3-query locally correctable codes to be exponential.

An [explanation of the result](https://twitter.com/EliBenSasson/status/1720001429207683174) referenced Reed-Muller codes, thus off we go for nerd sniping â€¦
